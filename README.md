# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Inspired by the work done at [Green Chameleon Studio](https://dribbble.com/greenchameleon "Green Chameleon Studio").
The animations seen on their feed are primarily done in After Effects so I wanted to set out to recreate some of the effects using either simple css or javascript.
This particular animation was inspired by [this gallery hover idea](https://dribbble.com/shots/4228572-Photo-Gallery-Hover-Idea "Green Chameleon animation").
Utilizes only css for the animations!
